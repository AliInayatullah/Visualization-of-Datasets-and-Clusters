# Visualization-of-Datasets-and-Clusters

The main objective of the project is to improve the presentation of data  by arranging it in a more organized and
easily identifiable manner, particularly with respect to groups of similar object classes.

Task 2 involves the application of the Signature Technique to rearrange a shuffled dataset, enabling it to be
reconstructed in its original form. On the other hand, Task 3 involves the utilization of unsupervised learning
in Machine Learning Models to visualize the data as clusters grouped by various data properties.

Data structures used:
-List
-Array
-Graph
-Matrix
